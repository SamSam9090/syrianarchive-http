The Syrian Archive is a Syrian-led and initiated collective of human rights activists dedicated to curating visual documentation relating to human rights violations and other crimes committed by all sides during the conflict in Syria with the goal of creating an evidence-based tool for reporting, advocacy and accountability purposes.

Our mission is to collect, preserve, verify, and analyse the most valuable material to ensure it is organized and accessible for use by current lawyers, investigators, human rights defenders, journalists and others involved in transitional justice and accountability efforts as well as to facilitate the work of future historians and researchers with an interest in the conflict.
