The Syrian Archive believes that open-source documentation of human
rights violations that is transparent, detailed, and reliable are
critical towards providing accountability and can positively contribute
to post-conflict reconstruction and stability. Such content can humanise
victims, reduce the space for dispute over numbers killed, help
societies understand the true human costs of war, and support truth and
reconciliation efforts.

In some cases, the Syrian Archive is able to conduct in-depth open
source investigations. Time and capacity limitations means not all
incidents are able to be analysed in-depth, however by developing a
replicable workflow it is hoped that others can assist in these efforts
of investigate other incidents using similar methods.

Reports are published simultaneously in English and Arabic to ensure the
feedback loop between the Syrian Archive and its network of sources is
closed.
