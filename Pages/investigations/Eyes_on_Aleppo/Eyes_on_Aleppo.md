# Eyes on Aleppo: Visual Evidence Analysis of Human Rights Violations Committed in Aleppo [July - Dec 2016] - Syrian Archive

## (I) Introduction

The Syrian Archive is a Syrian led-initiative striving to promote sustainable peace and respect for human rights within Syrian society through facilitating justice and accountability efforts. This includes evidence gathering and documentation of incidents; the acknowledgment that war crimes and human rights violations have been committed by all parties to the conflict; the identification of perpetrators to end the cycle of impunity; and the development of a process of justice and reconciliation.  

Through collecting, verifying, curating and investigating visual evidence, the Syrian Archive aims to preserve data as a digital memory to establish a database of human rights violations, and to act as a tool for legally implementing justice and accountability efforts as concept and practice in Syria.

Since its founding in 2014, the Syrian Archive have collaborated with organisations including Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International, Bellingcat and various agencies of the United Nations (UN), specifically the [Independent International Commission of Inquiry][1] on the Syrian Arab Republic.

The following [visual evidence dataset][2] complements and supports recent efforts by different groups which have been assisted by the Syrian Archive to report human right violations in Aleppo between July and Dec 2016. Those efforts include:

*   UN Human Rights Council (Feb. 2017): “[Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx)”

*   Atlantic Council (Feb. 2017): “[Breaking Aleppo](http://www.publications.atlanticcouncil.org/breakingaleppo/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BreakingAleppo.pdf)”

*   Human Rights Watch (Feb. 2017): “[Coordinated Chemical Attacks on Aleppo”](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/13/syria-coordinated-chemical-attacks-aleppo)

*   Various investigations by (July 2016 - March 2017 ) [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/?s=syria).

In this report, the Syrian Archive will describe and investigate a new [visual evidence dataset of 1748 videos][2] of human rights violations in Aleppo city and the surrounding suburbs in the period between July 2016 and Dec 2016.

While attacks and violations have been committed by all parties including the [International coalition][4] and Turkish forces, the visual evidence shows that the Syrian and Russian forces were responsible for the largest amount of human rights violations in Aleppo city and its suburbs during this period. These violations include:

* Attacks against hospitals, medical units, ambulances, schools, water stations, markets, mosques, bakeries and residential areas;
* The use of illegal weapons such as incendiary weapons and chemical weapons against civilians;
* Unlawful attacks on residential areas using cluster munitions;
* Attacks against humanitarian aid workers and citizen journalists;
* Attacks against women and children;
* Forced displacement of civilians.

**The report will be broken into the following sections:**

[(II) Research Methodology][5]  
[(III) Summary of Findings by Type of Violation, Munitions Used, and Geolocation][6]  
[(IV) Specific incidents of attacks using incendiary munitions][7]  
[(V) Specific incidents of unlawful attacks using cluster munitions][8]  
[(VI) Pattern of attacks against specifically protected persons and object][9]
