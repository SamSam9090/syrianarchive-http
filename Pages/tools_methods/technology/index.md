The Syrian Archive obtains and Archives data and files from a variety of sources and a variety of forms.  These are then stored in a centralized database, that our tools access to search, investigate, verify, categorize, and expand.  The technology that we develop allows teams of investigators to work together and publish subsets of data out of larger sets.  We call this the data pipeline.

To do this, the Syrian Archive contributes to open source software such as [Sugarcube](Sugarcube), as well as developing custom solutions for our verification Teams.  We release everything we create, so it can be reused by other groups outside of this project.
