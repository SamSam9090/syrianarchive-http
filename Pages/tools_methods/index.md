The Syrian Archive is unique in archival because we consider the developent and documentation of our open source tools and methods to be an integral part of the project. We have been using technology to manage our database, verification, and publishing, and releasing this methodology open source.

This allows for our workflows and data pipelines to be verified and transparent, as well as easing the workload of investigators and and verification teams.
We work in collaboration with other archival groups as well as lawyers and journalists to develop this methodology, and with other technologists to develop the open source tools.
