The Justice and accountability project at the Syrian Archive will help lawyers, and human rights investigators easily corroborate Visual documentation collected, preserved, and verified by the Syrian Archive with different types of evidence (official documents, witness testimonies) in order to strengthen the legal court cases they are building.

Collecting, preserving and verifying digital materials providing information about human rights abuses and war crimes are increasingly recognized as critical for justice and accountability efforts globally. The International Criminal Court has recently issued an arrest warrant for a Libyan national accused of being directly responsible for the killing of 33 people, based on video material and transcripts of video material, as well as social media posts.

In Germany and in Sweden, individuals have been found guilty of terrorist offenses and human rights violations due to content involving them posted to social media platforms. There is an emerging body of literature and case law in which user generated digital content from social media platforms has been used in legal environments.
